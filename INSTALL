-------------------------------------------------------------

 unpack:                    tar xf hmmer-3.3.tar
 move into new directory:   cd hmmer-3.3

For complete documentation, including customization and
troubleshooting, see the Installation chapter in the HMMER User's
Guide (Userguide.pdf).

The default installation location is under /usr/local, with
executables in /usr/local/bin.

HMMER is written in C (ANSI C99) for POSIX-compliant systems including
UNIX, Linux, and Mac OS/X.  HMMER will also work on Windows if you
install POSIX-compatibility software such as Cygwin.

HMMER is currently only supported on Intel-compatible processors
(including AMD) and PowerPC-compatible processors, because HMMER's
acceleration uses SIMD vector instructions (Intel SSE; PowerPC VMX
instructions).
